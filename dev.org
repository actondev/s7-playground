* S7 playground
** Preparation (emsdk)
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd ~/dev/github/emsdk
./emsdk install latest
./emsdk activate latest
source ./emsdk_env.sh
emcc -v
   #+END_SRC

** Building
   Note: =emcc= has to be in the path for the following to work

   Setting up project
   #+BEGIN_SRC src
meson setup build --cross-file wasm.ini
   #+END_SRC

   Building & launching
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
ninja -C build
# sometimes getting Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource
emrun index.html
# or (to be able to refresh - also seems more reliable?)
emrun --serve_after_close index.html
   #+END_SRC

   Useful snippets
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
node build/s7_wasm.js
   #+END_SRC
